# Presentation

## Overview

This course will introduce biologists to the field of genomics. We will cover basic analysis on genomics and then we will focus more about transcriptomics. We will cover experimental protocols and software, and analysis workflows that extend over the spectrum from the best practices in the quantitative analysis of RNA-seq data. This course will help the attendees gain accurate insights into gene differential expression analysis.

## Format

The course is structured in 10 sessions. Each session will include lecture of experiment protocol and key concepts for bioinformatics workflows. The remainder of each day will consist in practical hands on sessions. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. At the end of each session a small quiz will be hold.

## Targeted audience and required background

The course is aimed at L3 student from Sup'BioTech engineer school in learning how to do basic analysis in genomics and to design RNA-seq experiment and to extract biological insights from RNA-seq data.

Attendees should have a background in biology, but don't have to be familiar with genomic data and/or bioinformatics.

Practical exercises will use command-line Linux. Discussion about workflows will be hold but no coding exercises will be done by the students.

We will start by introducing general concepts of genomics and sequencing technology. From there, we will then continue to describe all major analysis steps from the raw sequencing data to the processed and usable RNA-seq data. Finally, we will focus more specifically on the different analyses strategies to use to extract information from RNA-sea datasets.

## Learning outcomes

- Knowledge on sequencing technologies
- Good practice to design RNA-seq experiments
- Processing of raw sequenced data
- Extraction of information from RNA-seq dataset with proper use of control and normalization
